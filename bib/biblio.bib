abstract = {Datacenter servers are often under-provisioned for peak power consumption due to the substantial cost of providing power. When there is insufficient power for the workload, servers can lower voltage and frequency levels to reduce consumption, but at the cost of performance. Current processors provide power limiting mechanisms, but they generally apply uniformly to all CPUs on a chip. For servers running heterogeneous jobs, though, it is necessary to differentiate the power provided to different jobs. This prevents interference when a job may be throttled by another job hitting a power limit. While some recent CPUs support per-CPU power management, there are no clear policies on how to distribute power between applications. Current hardware power limiters, such as Intel's RAPL throttle the fastest core first, which harms high-priority applications.In this work, we propose and evaluate priority-based and share-based policies to deliver differential power to applications executing on a single socket in a server. For share-based policies, we design and evaluate policies using shares of power, shares of frequency, and shares of performance. These variations have different hardware and software requirements, and different results. Our results show that power shares have the worst performance isolation, and that frequency shares are both simpler and generally perform better than performance shares.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of how Linux's performance has evolved over the past seven years. Unlike recent works that focus on OS performance in terms of scalability or service of a particular workload, this study goes back to basics: the latency of core kernel operations (e.g., system calls, context switching, etc.). To our surprise, the study shows that the performance of many core operations has worsened or fluctuated significantly over the years. For example, the select system call is 100% slower than it was just two years ago. An in-depth analysis shows that over the past seven years, core kernel subsystems have been forced to accommodate an increasing number of security enhancements and new features. These additions steadily add overhead to core kernel operations but also frequently introduce extreme slowdowns of more than 100%. In addition, simple misconfigurations have also severely impacted kernel performance. Overall, we find most of the slowdowns can be attributed to 11 changes.Some forms of slowdown are avoidable with more proactive engineering. We show that it is possible to patch two security enhancements (from the 11 changes) to eliminate most of their overheads. In fact, several features have been introduced to the kernel unoptimized or insufficiently tested and then improved or disabled long after their release.Our findings also highlight both the feasibility and importance for Linux users to actively configure their systems to achieve an optimal balance between performance, functionality, and security: we discover that 8 out of the 11 changes can be avoided by reconfiguring the kernel, and the other 3 can be disabled through simple patches. By disabling the 11 changes with the goal of optimizing performance, we speed up Redis, Apache, and Nginx benchmark workloads by as much as 56%, 33%, and 34%, respectively.},

    Abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software eevn more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased.  Developers with innovative ideas for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT.  The economies of scale of very large-scale datacenters combined with  ``pay-as-you-go'' resource usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue. Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.}
